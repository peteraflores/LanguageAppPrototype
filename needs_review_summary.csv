# NEEDS REVIEW SUMMARY
#
# How to use this file:
# 1. Review high-count rows first.
# 2. If neither tool is correct, manually enter the correct lemma.
# 3. Fill in:
#       approved_lemma
#       approved_upos
#       action = PROMOTE
# 4. Leave action blank to ignore.
# 5. Run promote_approved.py to add approved entries
#    into surface_lemma_lexicon.csv
#
# Notes:
# - surface_norm is what will be stored in the lexicon.
# - Counts represent number of occurrences seen.
# - You may override both tools if they are wrong.
